## 摘要 
### 目的 
了解北京市高中生吸烟行为及家庭因素与吸烟关联的性别差异，为相关干预提供理论依据。 

### 方法 
于2014年4~5月，采取分层整群随机抽样的方法，对北京市16669名高中生进行问卷调查。分性别采用卡方检验和多因素Logistic回归法分析家庭因素与吸烟行为的关联。

### 结果 
北京市高中男女生尝试吸烟率分别为40.7%和20.6%，13岁前吸烟率分别为16.1%和4.6%，现在吸烟率分别为24.3%和6.2%，重度吸烟率分别7.2%和1.0%，吸烟行为在性别间差异有统计学意义（卡方值分别为799.71, 601.33, 1078.60, 423.79，*P*均<0.05）。父亲职业与尝试吸烟、13岁前吸烟的关联以及母亲文化程度与13岁前吸烟的关联在男生中更强；而母亲文化程度与重度吸烟的关联以及家庭类型与尝试吸烟、现在吸烟和重度吸烟的关联在女生中更强。
  
### 结论 
北京市高中生吸烟行为性别差异较大，其中父亲职业与男生吸烟行为的关联程度较强，而家庭类型与女生吸烟行为的关联程度较强。由于男生各项吸烟率远高于女生，应对男生及早开展预防吸烟的健康教育，同时，由于中国人口基数大，也要重视预防女生吸烟。
