## Abstract

### Objective: 
To analyze physical fitness and health status and gender differences of middle school students among 5 minorities (Mongolian, Hui, Uyghur, Zhuang, and Korean) and to provide the theoretical basis for the strategy formulation.

### Methods: 
The present data came from 3 waves of Chinese National Survey on Students' Constitution and Health in 2010, 2014, and 2019. According to National Standards for Students' Physical Health 2014 Revision, excellent and excellent/good physical fitness and health status were defined. Cochran-Armitage test was used to examine the trends of physical fitness and health status. Chi-square test and Logistic regression were used to analyze the difference of physical fitness and health status by sex and survey year.

### Results: 
From 2010 to 2019, the excellent physical fitness and health status rate of Mongolian, Hui, Uyghur, Zhuang, and Korean students increased from 1.8%, 0.7%, 0.3%, 0.5%, and 1.3% to 4.3%, 2.8%, 1.2%, 1.3%, and 3.5%, respectively. The excellent/good physical fitness and health status rate of Mongolian, Hui, Uyghur, and Zhuang students increased from 12.9%, 8.0%, 7.2%, and 8.4% to 24.7%, 20.1%, 12.6%, and 19.8%, respectively. Cochran-Armitage test was used to examine the trends of physical fitness and health status. Chi-square test and Logistic regression were used to analyze the difference of physical fitness and health status by sex and survey year. In 2019, students aged 13 to 15 showed a higher proportion of excellent/excellent-good physical fitness and health status than those aged 16 to 18. Boys were more likely to be in excellent/excellent-good physical fitness and health status than girls from 2010 to 2019. The sex difference in excellent/excellent-good physical fitness and health status narrowed during 2010 and 2019.

### Conclusions: 
Physical fitness and health status of minority students improved while sex differences narrowed during the last decade, but there is still a long way to reach the goal proposed by China. Targeted interventions should be proposed to promote physical fitness and health status in accordance with the developmental characteristics, especially for girls and students aged 16 to 18.

## 摘要 
### 目的 
分析中国蒙古族、回族、维吾尔族、壮族和朝鲜族中学生体质健康状况及性别差异,为制定改善其体质健康干预措施提供理论依据。

### 方法 
基于 ２０１０、２０１４ 和 ２０１９ 年全国学生体质与健康调研数据，根据«国家学生体质健康标准(２０１４ 年修订)»定义体质健康优秀/ 优良标准， 使用 Cochran-Armitage趋势性检验分析体质健康状况变化趋势，使用 χ２检验和Logistic回归分析其性别和年度差异。

### 结果 
２０１０—２０１９ 年，蒙古族、回族、维吾尔族、壮族和朝鲜族学生体质健康优秀率分别从 １.８％，０.７％，０.３％，０.５％和 １.３％上升为 ４.３％，２.８％，１.２％，１.３％和 ３.５％，蒙古族、回族、维吾尔族和壮族学生优良率分别从 １２.９％，８.０％，７.２％，８.４％上升为 ２４.７％，２０.１％，１２.６％，１９.８％(Ｚ 值分别为 ６.１５，６.７１，４.１２，３.０６，５.２６，１１.８８，
１３.４２，６.７０，１１.０８，Ｐ 值均<０.０５)。 ２０１９ 年，各民族 １３~ １５ 岁学生体质健康状况优于 １６ ~ １８ 岁学生，男生优于女生，但性别差异在 １０ 年间出现缩小趋势。
  
### 结论 
五大少数民族学生体质健康状况在 ２０１０—２０１９ 年间有所改善，且性别差异缩小，但距离国家提出的目标仍有较大差距，需要针对女生、１６~ １８ 岁学生特点，进一步采取对应措施提高其体质健康水平。
